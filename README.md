# 🍸 DDS Recipe Overlay by Ace Eca! 🍸

## 🎯 Purpose

**DDS Recipe Overlay** is a nifty tool designed to make your gaming life easier! It helps you keep track of your recipes in-game, so you don't have to interrupt your play by tabbing out. It's like having your very own sous-chef, but for drugs! 

Though still under development, we're constantly working to add more awesome features. Your suggestions and feedback are more than welcome - help us shape this tool to be the best it can be! 🚀

## 📖 How to Use

### 🧪 Recipes Tab

This is your one-stop-shop for all things recipes! It displays all the drugs, ingredients, and mixes you've saved. 

- **Search and filter:** Looking for something specific? Use the search function! You can also filter items based on your needs. 
- **Item Details:** Click on an item and then click 'open' to see a simple details view with the item's stats and ingredients. (Stay tuned for a more detailed view coming soon!)
- **Refresh:** Just whipped up a new mix? Make sure to hit the refresh button to see your latest culinary...err, chemical creation!

### 🎨 Create Tab

Ready to channel your inner Walter White? This is where you can add your custom mixes!

## 🛡️ Anti-Virus False Positive Note

Hey there, just a heads up! 😊

Our program uses a public hook to render the menu in-game. This is totally normal, but some anti-virus software might get a bit nervous and flag it as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or even malware. Don't worry, our mod isn't here to cause trouble! 

To keep your anti-virus software calm and let the mod work its magic, you should add an exception for it in your anti-virus software. This tells your anti-virus that our mod is a friend, not a foe. 🤝

Enjoy gaming without any unnecessary interruptions! 🎮
